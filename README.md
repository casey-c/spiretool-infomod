# spiretool-infomod
Further README updates / improvements coming in the next few days, but here are some basics:

# Features
* Potion chance tracker - also tracks probability of getting a potion in _x_ more fights
* Available events (WIP - still some bugs to be ironed out in the coming weeks) - shows which events you can get from [?] floors
* Card chance tracker - lets you know the chance to see a rare card in the next combat reward screen
* Deck tool tip replacement - mouse over the deck icon in the top right to get a quick tool tip list of your cards
* Map tool tip replacement - mouse over the deck icon to see the current boss you will face (and previous bosses you have faced this run)
* [NEW!] Monster Compendium - shows the AI and movesets for all vanilla monsters (currently A20 only) - right click a monster during combat to bring up this overlay and right click again to close.
* SlayTheRelics integration - for streamers; various trackers are all included. Also works well with the Deck/Map tool tip improvements so newcomers can see your deck / boss while in combat. Currently does not work outside combat due to a limitation of the extension, but hopefully soon :)

# TODO
* Better README (with screenshots)
* Steam Workshop releases
* Some other planned features

# Current Installation Process
* Requires ModTheSpire and BaseMod. Download the InfoMod.jar from the releases page and then drop it into the SlayTheSpire/mods folder.
